All right. 

[00:00:05] **Leo:** Welcome back to How to Scale Yourself Today. My guest is Matt Eland. Matt, appreciate you being on the show. Uh, would love if you could just tell the audience a little bit about yourself and, and where you're coming from. 

[00:00:19] **Matt:** Uh, sure. Leo. Uh, so I was a software engineer, as I like to say, and then I, I took an arrow to the knee, uh, uh, was out on the bench for a little bit for some health issues, some minor paralysis, I guess we'll say.

Uh, and then I came back to, to software development, and I discovered, uh, more and more opportunities to mentor people and to, uh, invest in people. So, uh, I, I'm that kid who grew, Programming since I was seven. And I thought, you know, all my life, this is what I wanna do. I want to program, I wanna be a software engineer.

I wanna build awesome things. And then I think what I discovered is like, oh, oh my gosh, I care about people more. I care about helping people see, uh, that the software engineering's amazing. And so I actually get to teach now at, uh, tech Elevator, where a bootcamp throughout the United States, but I teach in our Columbus location.

And so I'm teaching, you know, uh, about 20 students. Uh, Four months or so, uh, I get to teach them.net, JavaScript, sql, all that good stuff. Um, and then I get to go out in my com in my community, my spare time, and I get to, uh, give really nerdy talks about really whatever I want. So I just, uh, I gave one today actually on automating my dog with Azure Cognitive Services, which is just, uh, That's a bizarre talk.

Right. But, uh, but it's fun for me and, uh, you know, I did a lot of speaking around this year about, uh, you know, I, is diehard a Christmas movie, is it not? And I, I built a machine learning model, uh, to determine whether or not it was, so I do a lot of fun stuff with data science and artificial intelligence.

I'm actually a, a master student as well. Uh, so I teach and I'm a student, which is kind of a very interesting. Uh, a place to be. Uh, but I really do love to learn and, uh, it's, this is letting me learn new things and share them with the community. And I, I, I, I just, uh, I just adore that. 

[00:02:01] **Leo:** Yeah, that's absolutely fantastic.

And you know, I think honestly, one of the fastest ways to accelerate your career growth in software engineering is to be teaching and learning constantly. And in fact, you know, the best teams that I've been part of it is very much that culture. It's everybody kind of learning things as they. And then sharing those, you know, learnings with the team and upskilling everybody because, uh, you know, you can get as good as you want to get, but in the end you are part of a team.

Um, and that that is just, uh, absolutely important in, you know, career growth. And I, I really appreciate your story cuz I, I've come to a, a very similar realization that a lot of what I do, um, is focused o on helping others. Teaching people kind of things I've learned along the way. Mm-hmm. . Um, and, and you know, like you coded from a, from an early age like that, that was all I was wanting to do.

I was so focused on that. Um, and, and so to kind of get that realization that there's a lot more to it. Um, and you know, so it, it comes whether. You know, looking at it from, you know, people management or education or product management even, you know, there, there's so many different things that go into it.

Um, and it's cool to, to build tools, but, uh, like we kind of chatted about, uh, before, you know, I tried to launch a startup and one of the things I realized was, wow, there was way more to it than just building software. So yeah, 

[00:03:31] **Matt:** there's a lot of stuff that gets in your way of, of actually coding and releasing something.

Yeah. 

[00:03:35] **Leo:** Um, But yeah, I'd love to dig just a little more into kind of going from the role of engineer to the role of educator and, um, kind of getting started with the boot camps. And, you know, so tell me a little bit kind of about that transition, you know, were, were there difficult parts in that or, or was it fairly seamless?

How did that go for you? So, 

[00:04:01] **Matt:** I, I'm a kind of cautious guy. Uh, or at least I have been, and. The first clue that I think I had was like, when I was paralyzed, I was spending a lot of time watching Pluralsight videos and like, and it, it kind of re-energized something in my, my heart about like, I love software engineering.

I love the craft of it. And I got out and I got to, I, I actually got to, to. We hired some of our earliest graduates from Tech Elevator at the company I was working with. And so I got to help mentor them cuz everybody else was so darn busy. Uh, and I had just been away for three months on, on, uh, short-term disability.

And so, you know, I had some freedom as I was coming back. And, and what I found was like I got to mentor them and, and help them see the world, uh, through my eyes and they're like, oh, oh, oh, this is really cool. And, and help guide them to things that were interesting to them. And so I've said, okay, you know what?

I got the back half of my career to look at. There might be something here. I, I think I should be leading a team. I think I should be, you know, looking at getting into management and, you know, maybe even, uh, teaching, uh, in the back half of my career that, or, you know, being a C T O C I O, something like that.

Um, and so I started actually working on my communication skills. I started writing, I started speaking at user groups and eventually conferences, um, started developing those skills that I might need if I went down either one of those two paths. I eventually did get to move off into management, and that was, that was a lot of fun.

Uh, you know, it was, it was, it's an interesting time. Uh, but I, I really enjoyed investing in people and, you know, everyone that reported to me, I, I, you know, I knew where I was trying to develop them. I knew where I was working with them. And, you know, I was delivering internal talks to our organization.

Like, okay, here's this new technology, or here's this antipater I've seen in a lot of our code base, here's the modern alternative. That, that kind of thing. Um, and so kind of like low risk ways of seeing. , like a, am I good at this? And, and B, do I enjoy this? Because once your resume goes from, you know, lead, lead software engineer to, you know, director for development or whatever it might be to teaching, um, it's harder to go back, or at least that was my thought, right?

Like, it's gonna raise some eyebrows, going, going from instructor back to developer or manager or something like that. So I wanted to be really sure I liked it. And, um, You know, ultimately I gave a number of conference talks. I got to talk with people, and it was just really energizing, seeing people love the stuff, uh, and, and invest in them.

And so I, I decided to take that plunge. Um, but for me it was, it was a lot of baby steps over a number of years. Uh, just building those skills and seeing like, is this really something I wanted to invest in? Uh, because I had so much on the line, I had a, I had a 15 years of development under my battle at that point.

[00:06:39] **Leo:** Yeah, that is, um, something that, that I've seen is, is. , you know, kind of separation between, you know, everyday engineering and then, you know, teaching, right? Mm-hmm. . Um, and I'm actually a, a believer that we need to do more of that a, a combination of the two. Um, and in fact, you know, one of the things that I love about technology is the fact that it's constantly changing.

It's constantly evolving, and we are seeing. Even faster with kind of AI ml, right? Like mind, this is crazy . And so I think, you know, moving forward, I I, I've been really enamored by the idea of this combined work education model and instead of the separation between like, you know, you go to school and then you get a job and you, you kind of learn on a job.

I really think companies need to do a better job of focusing on. Education while working. And in fact, my kind of ideal that I, I view is instead of the 40 hour work week, it's really a 20 hour work week and a 20 hour learning week. Mm-hmm. Um, especially for software engineering, but I think it actually extends beyond just that narrow realm because of the rise of no code tools.

And, and, you know, everything is software now and it's, it's. All evolving, right? So it's not just software engineers that have to learn all these, uh, new skills. So I, I'd love to kinda get your take on that and, and what you've seen. Have you seen a, any shifts in, in like, you know, companies and how they, they treat education or is it still kind of sticking to, to common patterns?

So, 

[00:08:16] **Matt:** uh, you know, I, I've seen, so I've been an, uh, an educator now for about three years. A little approaching three years here. But I, I've definitely seen organizations start to invest more formally in their, the education of their staff. Uh, we see at Tech Elevator, uh, you know, companies will try to upskill their, their staff by actually taking in people, sending them to our program for 14 weeks or 30 weeks.

We have for part-time and full-time programs. and, you know, kind of paying for that and then rehiring them back as developers. And, and I, I think that's, that's fantastic. You know, so you're taking somebody from a, you know, a, a non-development role and moving them into a development role in, in a short period of time while rewarding their loyalty at your company.

I think that's, that's pretty awesome. Um, you know, we definitely see that trend elsewhere in the industry, uh, as well. As far as like continuing learning and, and things like that. Um, you know, COVID sort of took things off the rails a little bit. You know, like we, we saw this trend of more and more companies are sending their developers to conferences, and then conferences are, are centers of people with, with germs and, uh, and covid and, you know, all these things.

Right? So that, that sort of, Put a pause on that, but it's, I think it's still important to people. Um, and with remote work and the, and the like, you know, you wanna make sure everybody's growing and learning and, and sharing what they're learning. Um, so I, I, I, I think there is this passion for we gotta keep learning and growing, but I'm not certain that organizations fully understand how to do that in the post covid world.

That's, that's sort of where, what I. 

[00:09:53] **Leo:** Yeah. I, I, I would agree with that too. I think it's, um, you know, companies do see things changing mm-hmm. , but because of the, the speed of change, you know, I, I, I see like from, from the employee standpoint, I think there's a lot of fear that comes along with change, right.

You know, when your entire livelihood is based around your job and there's a chance of it changing when. Like I, I think this is less true with software engineering just because of the rapid kind of haste of change in general. It's kind of expected, but with other roles it seems to be more of a fear of change because of the chance that it will evolve so rapidly that it evolves you right out of a job.

Right? Yeah. Yeah. And um, you know, I think that's really where there's a good chance to. Figure out how to like, invest and change meaningfully to make it a, a safe space to change, right? Like, you know, and, and an acknowledgement of the fact that the technological landscape is shifting and saying, Hey, look, we need people who can learn new skills and we're gonna support you along the way because, um, you know that that's gonna be needed.

Kind of a a, as we head into. Um, new economy where it's, you know, especially with all the like large language models and everything, right, like , it's, um, it, it's, it's unbelievable what is, what is possible now. So, 

[00:11:25] **Matt:** yeah. Well, let, let's talk, let's talk about that briefly, cuz I, yeah, let's do it. I think it's really interesting, you know, if I look at, you know, my wife or my mom or my sister, somebody who's not a programmer, I, I think in just a very short amount of time, they need some basic data literacy skills in order to interact with the world and understand the systems that they're interacting with.

Mm-hmm. , because you, you do have, you know, like even just simple machine learning classification, right? Like your loan is approved or it's not, you know, the, your insurance company covers this or it doesn't, or it's something's flagged or not. Well, even to understand what's going on in the world, going through.

Processes and systems and the like. You, you need to have some sort of data literacy. Um, absolutely. I, I think the change is only going to make that more important. And, you know, these, these transformer based models you were talking about, these are, you know, That, that paper about, uh, attention is all you need.

That was, that was five years ago. Right. Uh, and, and for context, you know, the ob the object classification, image classification technology behind self-driving cars, that's 25 years old at this point. So like it's mm-hmm. , uh, we're gonna see a, a continued amount of whirlwind of change as, as time goes on, and it, it's definitely gonna impact some industries for.

[00:12:37] **Leo:** Yeah, I, I, I would definitely, um, a agree with that. And in fact, uh, one of the things that I, I've been working on is a Minecraft themed horse on, so it's, it's data mining with, with Minecraft, right? Like, so essentially I love it, essentially like the idea of, you know, using data as, as building blocks for systems.

Mm-hmm. , um, because yeah, I, I fully agree that people need this basic understanding of what data is and how it moves between systems. , um, you know, and, and you don't need a ton of knowledge around that. You just kind of need the mental models to be able to have this basic understanding of how it works. And in fact, with these large language models, if you understand kind of where it's collecting all that data from and knowing how to interact with that, um, 

[00:13:27] **Matt:** and, and know the limitations of it, 

[00:13:29] **Leo:** and know the limitations of it, right?

Like it's, uh, you know, it's. Magic. It feels like magic a lot of times. It really does like, and you know, um, it, and, and I guess in some ways it, it almost is, yeah. Because it kind of hit a certain scale where all of a sudden these emergent properties started happening and everyone's like, wait a minute.

Like, we can actually use this for all sorts of things now. Yep. Um, but you know, again, the, the underlying pieces of it, Terribly complicated, and I'm, I'm they, they are, but they aren't. Right. Like . Um, but, you know, kind of the, the general way to think about these things I think is, um, something that, that anybody can grasp, um mm-hmm.

given, you know, put, put the attention, um, to it and actually try to understand it. I, I think anybody can. So I would love to know then, kind of shifting, I guess slightly. Sure. What, um, so what's your approach to the boot camps? And you said you were kind of teaching a number of different, uh, languages. So what does that curriculum include?

Does it actually touch on like machine learning? How much of it is like, specialized like you do kind of, uh, here's like a, a. Basic class, you know, web app development. Do you do anything with like data engineering? You do. How, how far, I guess, do you branch out in the, in the bootcamp? So 

[00:14:56] **Matt:** we, we offer them two choices.

Uh, the first choice is, do you want to, to learn, I guess we offer three choices. Uh, first one is, do you wanna do full-time or part-time? So 14 weeks or 30. Second choice we give them is, do you want to do, uh, in-person or remote? So if they're full-time, you know, we give them the option of being at one of our full-time in-person campuses, uh, such as ours in Columbus.

Uh, and then some markets, we, we also give them a choice of, do you want Java or.net. Uh, but that is actually the, uh, about the, the current limitations of our, the choices we offer. Because what we do offer is very tailored towards the markets that we, that we operate in. So, okay. We teach them, you know, either Java or.net, um, C Sharp, uh, where they are learning object oriented programming.

They're learning get, they're learning unit testing, they're learning, you know, source control, working, working with the compiler, working with the dev tools. Um, They're really focusing on like, how, how do I program, how do I understand objector development classes, uh, objects, methods, you know, things like that.

Uh, we covered data structures as well to some degree. Uh, but we're really trying to build web developers. That's our, that's our sweet spot, is building web developers. Okay. We get people who come in there and they become analysts. They become, uh, you know, testers, they become DevOps, uh, business analysts, things like that.

Um, but our sweet spot spot is making web developers. So we spend, so in the full-time program, we spend a month on that. And, uh, on just object ordinary programming in general. We give 'em a big project, they complete it. They need to lay down for half a week, uh, . Uh, and then we move on to the next module, which is where we're teaching them SQL Q.

We're teaching them, you know, relational databases, uh, normalization, performance, you know, uh, making changes, scripts, things like that. Um, we get into APIs. We're very, very, very heavy on APIs. So they're building a, uh, A web server using Spring Boot or asp.net. Um, and, and they're using Postman and understanding the re request back and forth between the systems.

So then they build another big project and then we kick 'em off to the front end. , they're learning HTL c s s and they're like, this is so different. And then they, we show 'em JavaScript in a whole new context. Cause they kind of do a little bit of JavaScript before they even come into the program just to get 'em exposed to programming concept.

without like taking, you know, decent chunk of their money first . Right. Cause you know, ethics, right? That's, that's important to us. We, we care about our students. Um, And then they're building wonderful things in JavaScript and uh, uh, we teach 'em Vja s as a front-end framework. You know, we find that's a really good one for getting them exposed to the ideas of front-end frameworks.

Even though only a fraction of 'em will go into jobs as a UJA s developer, they're able to go off and learn React or Angular or, uh, you know, blazer Razor or W P F or whatever it might be, right? Like whatever data bound framework it is of the, of choice. Um, and then they spent like the last two weeks of the program.

like really big applications in an agile environment. It's, it's a lot of fun. So, uh, it's really intense. They're really immersed in this stuff cuz we're, they're getting three, four hours of lecture a day and they're getting four hours of homework a day. Like, it's, it's insane what we ask of them. But, but they come out really strong, uh, if they put the effort in and we help them with interviewing as well.

But really we're making web developers. That's our sweet. So, um, the students who I get to teach, you know, on breaks and, uh, over lunch and in the afternoons we're doing lightning talks, they don't, they're getting exposed to data science 1 0 1 if that's what they're interested about. But, you know, I try to feel out what, what any student is interested about and I try to, you know, kind of whisper to them what I know of it and give them resources toward, towards it.

Cuz you get people who are really focused on security and really focused on AI and Python or game development or whatever it might be. And so I try to be a generalist just so I can point people in the right. Sorry. Long 

[00:18:45] **Leo:** answer . No, no, no, no. That's fantastic. Um, cuz you know, I kind of, I, I went the more traditional, uh, you know, route got a a, a BS in computer science.

Yep. Same. Um, and you know, I, I've, I've worked with people actually, um, who went through tech elevator. Um, and I, I was always impressed with, with how they came out of there, but I didn't have a lot of insight into kind of the overall structure of it. So I I appreciate you sharing that. Yeah. Um, 

[00:19:11] **Matt:** it's, I was, I was shocked at how intensive it was when I came on staff.

[00:19:14] **Leo:** Yeah. Cuz it, like, I, I kind of found like, you know, with, with the computer science degree, I, I wouldn't say that I came out really knowing how to write software. Mm-hmm. I understood, you know, the principles behind it and all of. Um, but you know, to, to give you some insight too, it's like, I came out of college and like, you know, we had this big senior design class where we actually built an iPhone app, uh, way back in like the earlier days of the iPhone.

But, um, we did it and, and we, we spent the whole class like learning the waterfall methodology of software development, . And then I ca and then I came out and everyone's like, agile. And I'm like, what's agile? ? Like, you know, welcome to technology, right? And so that was, uh, you know, it. It was really good to come into a place that actually spent a lot of, um, time and energy educating people as they came in.

Uh, I, I was exposed to a number o of like classes. Like they, they threw me into from the get-go, like I was put in, you know, courses on, you know, spring development. I, I was put in courses on object-oriented design. Like they had like the, this training program that was. You know, a couple a year, I think. And, and it was, uh, it, it was really extensive in, in helping me kind of, um, upskill and I, I think, you know, that was kind of where I was able to develop that.

Just love of learning on the job, you know, having that supportive environment is so, so vital. 

[00:20:44] **Matt:** Yeah. Uh, I, I benefit from that, from tech elevator. Like, uh, they give me a certain, you know, allowance I suppose we might say for, for educational material. And so, you know, I'm taking a course right now on ml.net and I actually, you know, teach some ml.net in the community, but I wanna make sure I, you know, I'm, I'm really good at it, you know what I mean?

Right. If I'm gonna be helping people with it. And so if there's something I can learn, that's great. And also just seeing how people teach it differently is, is, has value to me as an educator. Yeah. Um, Yeah. And, and, and you, you know, they pay for part of my master's program as well. And, and I think it's little things like that, whether it's paying for books or having a library around, uh, that can, I think, really help people internalize that culture of learning.

Um, I get really excited when I tour a place and they have a library for , for, for people. It's, it's, uh, uh, it's a cheap way. Win me over, I suppose. Or maybe not that cheap Books are expensive, but, well, 

[00:21:39] **Leo:** I I, I totally appreciate that. So, yeah. Um, my, uh, my, my first job was actually with the online computer library center.

Okay. Uh, up in Dublin, so, yep. Um, I, I was there for about five years. So yeah, I definitely have a big appreciation for libraries, but, uh,

But let's, uh, let's, let's shift a little bit. Sure. And you know, one of the things that, that I was, um, really impressed with was, you know, not only are you kind of doing this teaching, um, in your day job, you're also putting out quite a bit of content. You've got a blog, YouTube channel. Um, so tell me a little bit about, you know, how you got into the content creation side of things and how you've, um, experienced that and, you know, building an online presence and.

You know how you've just kind of developed that over, uh, over time in addition to kind of your other teaching. So I'm gonna 

[00:22:32] **Matt:** tell you based on my best recollections, which is probably not accurate, but Fair enough. Um, so I was managing a team of.net developers and I was looking for ways of developing my team, you know, which includes some, some younger folks.

And there was a conference that was opening up in, in Columbus for the first time. It was called, uh, JavaScript in France. Uh, you know, they're still active. And I heard about this conference, and so, you know, I took, uh, one of the guys on our team. We, we went, we, we walked around. We, we went to all the, the talks.

And I remember sitting in the first one and I'm like, huh, you know, these people aren't that special. They're just sharing what they know. They're just talking about their own learning journeys. They're not. You know, perfect people with just amazing backgrounds. They're just people who have learned something and they're sharing it with others.

They're, they care about the community. You know, I, I could invest in people like that. You know, there's something that, that clicked in this first little session with just two presenters and six people in the, in the room. , it was a, a very sparsely attended talk was that, that one Blizz. But, uh, something clicked there and so I said, you know, I've got a, a lot of things I could.

And so the week after that, there was the, um, the call for proposals or call for papers for Code MASH 2020. And I said, you know what? Uh, sure. I, I, I'll, I put some stuff out there on technical debt and uh, uh, and then I, and then I panicked. I said, well, oh no, these people have no idea who I am. Um, I should probably share some of my ideas for, uh, for this.

And so like, I, I went, A little off the deep end, and then I went way off the deep end. And so what I did is, is every day in September and like late August that year, I wrote an article on something. Um, and I, I think I started on Medium and nobody saw anything. And then a friend of mine suggested I, I check out dev two, uh, the, the blogging site.

And what I found is that the technical community out there was really supportive and really encouraging, and they taught me new things. And that by me sharing things with other people, I refined my own knowledge as. Alluding to earlier. Um, and I was able to learn about new things from the comments that people would, uh, leave.

Um, and then, you know, I got picked to speak and so I said, oh crap. Well now I really gotta prepare. And then they gave me like the biggest room in like the opening time slot and I'm like, oh, hey , no pressure, Matt. Uh, first conference talk. Uh, and so, you know, I went way off the deep end and I prepared and prepared and I like as.

Prep for this. I published an article on e on everything. So I knew my talk inside and out. I knew all sorts of things about it, and I shared it with the community and I learned more in the process as well. Um, and I think, you know, after I, I finished that, it was like, kind of like, okay, well now what? Well, I, I, I've seen, I have the ability to help people and I care about this and I like this and I benefit from this and my employer benefits from this.

You know, things like that. And so it's like, okay, well let's keep doing this. And so, Continue to share about software engineering and as I've been learning more, more about data science, artificial intelligence, I've been trying to share that as well, either through YouTube or uh, or through blog posts. Um, you know, sometimes things get really popular.

Sometimes things get ignored. Sometimes things get really popular in ways I don't like very much . I woke up this morning to find a piece that I had made three years ago was very popular and people were yelling at it cuz it had bugs in it. Well, uh, it's like Matt, Matt, Matt. This, this is really well, well written.

And people started re replying, like, yeah, but you're getting, you have this big misconception about threading. It's like, dang it past Matt. Come on, . Uh, so, so to some extent you need a little bit of a thick skin, but, uh, Uh, yeah, I've learned a lot from writing. I've learned a lot from speaking. I've gotten better and I've, yeah.

It, it, it's helped people too. I think that's really matters. 

[00:26:22] **Leo:** Yeah. That is, um, that, that is really where it's, where it's at, you know, in, in, in the heart of it. And so I had kind of a, uh, rough introduction to the world of content, cuz I started off with like writing on medium. Mm-hmm. much the same way. Um, and that was kind of how I discovered, like, you know, I got, got like my first dollar off a median I'm, and I'm like, wait, I can actually like, make money doing this.

Like, th this is phenomenal. Um, and so I ended up like taking, uh, this writing course and I, and I got really into it. Um, and I, I ended up like writing about this political argument that I got into with my. Oh no, this was 2020. Um, and uh, it completely blew up in like all of the wrong ways. Um, and uh, that was my introduction to like, so one, one thing that I really took away from that was that like people on both sides of the argument completely ignored the actual details of what I wrote.

Yes. Um, and, and so they were injecting all sorts of their own experiences and context into. The, the, the piece that I wrote and, uh, it was kind of like the, the darkest side of content creation. Yep. And so the good part is that after that, if I write something and it gets ignored, I'm like, this is totally fine.

um, you know, uh, cuz I, I hit. It was like 200,000 views over a weekend. Yep. That's, that's, that's a lot. That, that is a lot. And like, you know, there, like, part of it was like this, like you get kind of this, this rush of like, you know, the, the dopamine as you see the numbers climb. Um, but it was, uh, yeah, I, I, I, I realized that that isn't why I started writing online in the first place.

Mm-hmm. . Um, and so I, I kind of got. Treating content a a, a bit differently after that. Um, and I actually, I, I, I was a speaker at Code Mash as well. Mm. Um, uh, a few, I guess it's been a few years now. Um, and it was like, it was my second conference, not my first. And, uh, I'll be honest, it did not go as well as I had hoped.

Um, I, I didn. I didn't do a great job prepping enough for it. And that was, that was something that I, I, I learned. Um, and actually since the pandemic, I, I now realized that I had undiagnosed A D H D, which made things a lot harder. Um, so now it's like, I'm like, okay, well now I understand what I would have to do to actually like, get fully prepared.

Um, but at least I wasn't like in one of the huge rooms on opening day. I will say I was. It was a smaller room, uh, toward the end of the conference. I think it was, uh, Friday afternoon. But, um, still, still a fair number of people, uh, but a, a great experience because it was one of those, like, I was, I was just like you and trying to put myself, um, you know, I kind of pushed myself outta my comfort zone a little bit.

And I'm not always great at just the, the nice small steps and seeing like, oh, like let's test the water. It's like, yeah, let's throw myself off the deep end and see what happens. . Which, uh, you know, you, you'd develop a bit of a tolerance for pain, I guess, at that point. But I, I, I 

[00:29:46] **Matt:** do think that code Mesh is a great conference to speak at because, you know, even if someone was really hoping to get a lot outta your talk and, and you failed them, uh, well that's harsh language there.

Uh, but let's say that your talk was completely catastrophe, they still have the rest of the conference to, to learn from. Right. That's just 

[00:30:02] **Leo:** it. I, I, you know, it wasn't, um, like I, I, I, I feel like it, it, it definitely. , it wasn't great. I'm hoping that it was educational for, for some people and, and you know, it, it was, it took me a little bit cuz like, I, I only got like six comments on my session and like, none of them were positive, but there weren't like, I think, you know, 50 or a hundred people in the room.

Like, I, I forget there was, there was a good number of people, you know, actually in the room, um, throughout, and I was. So I, I didn't wow anybody and that's okay. But only a few people thought it was bad enough that they needed to leave a comment. And those comments are actually helpful, right. Like, they help me, um, yeah.

You know, work on it in the future. Yeah. So it is, uh, it is interesting when you put yourself out there and, and do stuff like that because you, you kind of get to learn like, Uh, you know, what it takes. And I, I think that's one of the biggest things. And, and I, I wish I had done more of the, like, you know, talking at meetups and things like that before I did conferences, but I, I, I was lucky enough to have a managers, it's like, oh, you should like, submit talks to conferences.

Like, I think that would be good for you. I was like, okay, I'll do that. Um, , but you know, it's, uh, it, it is one of those so you can kind of learn from it and, and figure out, um, you know, where to. 

[00:31:21] **Matt:** I, I am still shocked, uh, at me speaking at conferences, by the way, like, uh, this year I think. I think it came out to 18 talks.

Uh, some wow persons, some online. Yeah. It, it was, it was a pretty crazy amount cuz work just kept, kept saying yes, if it's in our, our target markets, yes, we got you covered. Go, go. Um, go help people understand that our grads are awesome. Go help understand that, you know, the program is good, you know, that kind of thing.

So I got to travel around, you know. Northeastern Eastern United States talking about diehard this year. And that was, that was kind of fun. 

[00:31:50] **Leo:** Um, that, that is pretty awesome. And actually I did want to come back to that. Yeah. And so I assume that the machine learning algorithm came out that it in fact is a Christmas movie.

Well, we'll, we'll, 

[00:31:59] **Matt:** we'll get to that later. Let's, let's say . Okay. I just wanna finish my point here. Uh, but. I was that kid in high school who gave the talks to my teacher's shoes, like over lunch with nobody else in the room. And I, I was a kid who would just get nauseous at it. So it's really interesting to me looking back and saying like, h h how, what happened to that guy?

How did I change? And I think, I think it's, you know, I care about the topic. I care about the people I'm, I'm, I'm sharing with, um, and I think part of my journey this year is you can talk to a room of 300 people. and you can talk to a room of eight people. Um, and they're both important. Um, and part of my journey right now is prioritizing my time and like, is it better for me to be there as an extra support resource for our students when I'm, you know, when it's not like one of my teaching cohorts?

Or is it better for me to be active in our community and, you know, potentially help some students get placed in a job sooner? You know? and, and, and trade-offs between, I guess numbers and volume and time, time of exposure around people. So, you know, I, I'm, I'm looking at my time differently for 2023 and I'm, I'm like, what if I did less of this in-person speaking and I did more of the community engagement, more of the community building, more, we're helping conferences with, uh, speaker selection more, you know, whatever it might be.

Um, and I focused less on like raw count. Of people in, in the room and more on just like, can I find ways on Twitter or LinkedIn or whatever it is to mentor people beyond just the people I get paid to mentor, uh, who I really do like mentoring still, like I I, every grad of mine, I, I want them to keep in touch with me on Slack and just talk to me every day about the random stuff that they're dealing with, you know, to the extent that they can.

I don't know. I guess I'm, I'm sort of rambling, but it, it's, it's sort of what you care about, so it's No, 

[00:34:01] **Leo:** no. Yeah, no, no. That's absolutely fantastic. And that is something that is, I, I think, tough to do. Yeah. Um, and, you know, figuring out how to prioritize that. So I kind of, alongside that, I, I'm curious, like, so you say you gave 18 talks.

Was that 18? Like. Completely different talks topically, or do you give the same one 18 times? Do you have kind of a few that you rotate around? How does that work? 

[00:34:23] **Matt:** You know, I, I don't think I've done a distinct count of talks. Uh, for this year. I'd say I probably gave seven distinct talks this year. Okay. Uh, most places it was diehard, you know, there's a couple things on Azure machine learning that, that were common.

there's a talk I give on basically data science 1 0 1, that, that got picked up in a number of places. Um, just like what's out there, right? . Um, for me, I, I'm happier creating a new talk, a talk, a new topic, but I also over prepare. And so if I'm over preparing for a new talk, that means I'm not making YouTube videos or, uh, a new article or, you know, some, something else that could potentially help other people.

So, um, It's, it's sort of like, how do I be smart with my time because my time can really help people. And if I'm spending three weeks preparing for something where there's six people in the room, is that, is that, is that a good idea? And, and I think the answer still might be maybe, and yes, and depending on the six people and how much they wanna ca keep in touch, but, you know.

Yeah. 

[00:35:26] **Leo:** So one, one thing that kind of pops into my head there, like, ha, have you given any thought? Creating kind of a preparation process that involves creating content along the way. And so like I'm a big believer in kind of this build and public mentality, right? Mm-hmm. . So a lot of the content I create is based off of the stuff that I'm actually building, and I just talk about what I'm building right?

And how I'm doing it and, and kind of that sort of thing. Because that felt much easier for me than, than trying to kind of do. Very specific content, a a around, you know, given ideas. So like, I'm, I'm curious, have you, again, I remember you said you did, uh, do that approach, kind of prep, prepping for your, you know, initial, uh, presentation.

Right? You wrote like blog every day trying to get that stuff out there. But, um, yeah, I'd just love to to get more insight into that. 

[00:36:15] **Matt:** Yeah. So, I've been doing that approach, uh, particularly with certification tests. So like there I mentioned trying to generalize and so I, I'm generalizing on the Azure platform, if that makes sense.

So I'm specializing in generalizing at the same time. So the whole breadth of Azure just getting the fundamental certifications, which I, I achieved last year and that's how I discovered like, oh, I really like this AI stuff. I really like this AI stuff. , like, not even funny how much I like this AI stuff.

Um, and then as I, as I get deeper into like the, uh, Azure data scientist, Azure AI engineer certifications, which I, I got both of this year. I'm like, okay, well as I'm learning this, I'm learning this and this and this, and this was hard for me, so I'm gonna write about it. This was hard for me, so I'm gonna do a video about it.

Uh, I've actually got a pretty big backlog of those things. Um, that I haven't gotten to convert into, into content because I've been prepping for my speaking obligations. I did. I don't, you know, if, if I get selected by somebody and work is okay with me, you know, taking off and traveling, you know, I don't want to give a bad talk.

Mm-hmm. it, it does occasionally happen, uh, , but, uh, but I wanna do everything in my power to reduce the odds of that. Right. So that's part of why I, I wanna see like, can I do more of this just. Dynamic content creation of the stuff that I am learning, the stuff that I am playing with, um, that's just fun for me.

Mm-hmm. , uh, the, the downside of that is that if I do something really fun for me, it's harder for people to discover. So if I'm writing up like, is Diehard a Christmas movie? Here's what machine learning says. You know, there's some search for that. Not a lot. Um, if I'm teaching a, a, an AI algorithm to play one night Ultimate Werewolf by Bezier games like , there's probably not a lot of search for that, but it's a really interesting project to me.

And if I'm trying to automate my dog with Azure Cognitive Services, Yeah. Uh, nobody's searching for that. Uh, or, or I'm afraid if they are, you know, . Uh, so it, it is like how do you get people to discover this stuff? And so you have these, these projects that people who know you can benefit from, but you also have to bi mix it out with just some generic stuff that people are actually just looking for.

So, uh, I dunno, it's, it's, it's interesting. 

[00:38:28] **Leo:** Yeah. That's actually, so, um, one of. Things that I've been, I'm working on building out, is actually based around this idea of making it easier to discover the content catalog of kind of individuals. Right? Yep. Because, you know, like you, it's like, you know, I do stuff on YouTube, do the podcast, do writing occasionally, like I'm, I'm all over the place, right?

Um, and that is not good for kind of, you know, sustained growth because they're all very, very separate. Mm-hmm. . And so one of the things that I would really like to do is give people away, like if they discover me on one of these platforms, how can they then like do a, a search of my catalog specifically?

Um, and you know, I, I think there's definitely some room there because, um, you know, I, I hate the idea of having to compete on YouTube against. All the other YouTube videos, right? Like, sure, because I, I, I'm not competing on things like, um, you know, video production or y y you know, these like huge, uh, out outlandish things or whatever, right?

Like that, that's not kind of what I'm doing. And so much more of what I do is, you know, it's just talking about things that I find interesting and, and, and doing things like that. And so figuring out ways to. Those kinds of topics and, and, you know, uh, content more discoverable I think is, uh, it, it's just a, it's a really interesting problem, kind of based on, on the way the internet is structured now.

Mm-hmm. . Um, so yeah, I, I, I think there should be more value in, in, you know, um, Trying to, you know, automate your dog, because I think that is a fascinating topic and I, I definitely wanna hear more about that too. 

[00:40:14] **Matt:** Yeah. Well, well, just, just, just to allay any fears. My, my, you know, no animals were harmed during the creation of the article, software projects, thumbnail for the videos.

Anything else? So I was, it was just like, Hey, how can I teach Azure Cognitive Services in an interesting way? It does computer vision, it does text to speech. It does speech to text. How can I teach this in a fun way? And also, I play a game of what's the weirdest thing I can submit to a conference that gets accepted?

Um, and, and that one got accepted. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's like, well, my dog sits out, sits and he, he watches out the window to see if he, there's this rabbit, and if there's a rabbit, he barks. You know, he listens to my words and he interprets my words. Th those are all things that Azure, you know, kind cognitive services can do with AI as a service.

And so, like, that's a, a really weird way of, of sharing it. You know, diehard, like most people when they're learning classification in machine learning, they're trying to predict if someone would've lived or died on the Titanic. It's very morbid, but that is the standard. And I said, no, we're not, we're not having that.

Um, I, I passed the, the Azure AI Fundamentals exam, uh, weekend before Halloween last year, and then I, I was scr scrolling through Reddit and my wife. I, I, I realized I hadn't asked her about diehard, and I found a meme about it. It's like, Hey, Hannah, what do you think? And she's like, well, why would it be a Christmas movie?

I'm like, no, it totally is. Uh, and then I'm like, wait a minute. I can get an objective opinion on this. And so I, I, I fed a whole bunch of information about movies. Uh, and as well, as well as whether or that movie should be considered a Christmas movie or not, based on whether or not it appeared on, you know, multiple lists of like common Christmas movies was kinda my criterion.

I had Azure machine learning go out and train a machine, a bunch of machine learning models. It says, Hey Matt, this one performs the best. Um, you know, went through a bunch of stuff to get my metrics high enough that I could trust the model that it suggest. And gave it information about diehard, it gave me back, uh, uh, you know, Yippy, CAE Diehards a Christmas movie.

Uh, so, you know, it gave me the right answer. Uh, but I was a hor, it was a horribly biased thing, even though I was trying not to, to inject my bias into it. But, uh, uh, no, that's, that's one of my favorite projects I've ever done. Um, but it's funny cuz like I did, didn't even occur to me that it might predict no, uh, until, until like several days into this project.

It's kinda funny. , um, But I think, I think numbers aren't everything, right? There's, there's quantity and quality. Uh, because if you look at my numbers, you know, I've got thousands of people reading my articles, which is nice. Like, that's weird, but it's also nice. Um, and then you look at the number of people I get to directly teach each year, and that's, you know, uh, maximum of 60, right?

Uh, there's a big difference between one person I teach and one person who reads. My, uh, articles are watches a video, uh, or attends a talk of mine in terms of lasting impact. And I, I, I think it's good to have a range of things that you do because I, I'm helping people search for answers with articles and videos.

I'm helping inspire people with my talks, uh, and making them aware of things that they can then go out and learn. Um, but the active mentorship in on LinkedIn, Twitter, in person, uh, you know, user groups like I, I helped run the central ohio.net developer group or conig. Um, and then, you know, Active relationships with those grads and students.

Uh, I, I, I think that end of things with where the numbers are the lowest just is, you know, the, the best way you can do it, whether it's one person at work or, um, someone you know from, from church or your community or whatever it is. I, I, I feel like sometimes that's the biggest impact that gets the least amount 

[00:43:54] **Leo:** of attention.

I, I completely agree with that. And, uh, in fact, one of the things that I, I tend to use Twitter for, um, are kind of, uh, coffee chats. And I, I went through a period where I was doing coffee chats with a bunch of the, uh, hundred devs community. Yeah. I love those guys. Uh, it, I, I was blown away, honestly. Yeah.

Like, uh, you know, between the, the, the program and how it's structured and the, the quality of people that are, are going through that and, and Yep. You know, uh, just, just everything. And it was so awesome to just get to talk to them and, uh, you know, hear their experiences and, and be able to connect with them on that level and, and then, you know, offer myself as, as, um, as a resource if, if they need it.

Yeah. Uh, you know, because it's just, um, I, I think it's, it's. I kind of joke that, uh, one of the problems with tech right now is that there's too many tech people in Tech . Um, and so, you know, and I say this fully as someone, you know, a tech person in tech, yes. But yes, it's kind of that, uh, you, you know, again, as we kind of talked about at the beginning, you know, this, um, you, you kind of get focused on the, on the tech part of it, and then you realize like, oh wait, actually, like there's people involved and it's this whole big thing.

And so seeing people from kind of the, these various backgrounds getting into it and, and bringing in different insights and different perspectives, I think it, it really is going to unlock a whole different era of software development. Yeah. Leah, the, 

[00:45:27] **Matt:** this is why I love my job, um, right. The people that I get to meet as a.

Are incredible. The people that will be graduating, uh, our class on Friday, this week. Um, you know, I'm gonna cry when I see some of these. Like, so-and-so got a job. Um, it, it really gets to you at an emotional level. It's, it, it's, it's something incredible and you get to, to know folks and you see what getting into tech means to somebody and their family and the things that they were coming from and, and.

The joy it can bring to people's life. Um, it, it, it's really absolutely incredible. Um, we all care a lot about our students on staff, uh, , we get, we get very choked up over our students. Uh, and I, I think, I think the community needs to keep people in mind more. Uh, cuz we have not figured out how to interview people right in, in tech at all.

And. , things like chat. G p t are only gonna change that , you know, because it's, you know, interview trivia and projects and leak code and things like that. It's like sometimes just get to know somebody, see what they can do, you know, I don't have good answers for it. 

[00:46:35] **Leo:** Like, um, you know, get, get to know them and give them a chance.

Give them a, a place to succeed. Um, and, and I, I, People can astound you. Yep. Um, but the, there's all of these weird structures that we put in place and, you know, hoops that we want people to jump through. Um, and we're, we're, it's. We're 

[00:46:56] **Matt:** afraid of making mistakes, we're afraid of, right, of hiring somebody who doesn't work out.

And so what we do is we say, I wanna find somebody who looks like me. Uh, they don't, not necessarily have to physically look like me, but they have to be awesome in all the ways that, that made me awesome. So, uh, they have to be somebody who's, who's working, uh, late into the evenings learning new things.

It's like, okay, great. Well there goes single moms and, you know, people taking care of their families. And you know, we, we don't have good answers for these things. We have a lot of wrong. 

[00:47:26] **Leo:** And you know, I think part of it to me is why I believe so strongly that like companies should invest more heavily in that education piece of it.

Because if you control a fair amount of the education part of it, you don't need to get the perfect answer in there right away because you're gonna help them get to the place you want them to be. Mm-hmm. . And you know, if you have that direct control all of a sudden, Mistakes aren't really the same level of mistake because you're, you're able to, um, you know, get people in.

And again, you don't need people learning in their off hours because that's all part of it that's assumed to be part of the process, as opposed to this like, oh, we're gonna call that passion for the craft and we expect you to just come with it. And it's like, well that's, that's not reality right there.

There's more to life than that. It's not balance either. Right. All right. Well, we are coming up on time here, but I do wanna end with just, um, you know, a any kind of insights that we haven't touched on, things that you've learned in your journey, um, that, that you'd like to share. I think, uh, would be great to kind of get anything that you've got 

[00:48:38] **Matt:** there.

Y you know, I think the, the biggest thing that is one that we've already talked, uh, touched on, You know, I thought I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up in quotes, uh, from a, from, from an early age. And in fact I love programming. I love software engineer. Um, , it's okay to be wrong about yourself. It's okay to think that you wanted one thing and want something else.

Uh, you're gonna find yourself suddenly surprised by the things that you like and the things that you don't like in life. You're gonna suddenly find yourself surprised by some of the things that you're good at that you didn't even consider as something that you're good at. You know, I am good at taking technical things and.

Helping people understand them in simple ways. I am good at reassuring people who are stressed. I, you know, there's all these little things that you didn't even think were part of your skillset cuz you're so focused on, I'm really good at Angular or what, whatever it might be. Right. Uh, Uh, and, and as AI, uh, gets better at generating code and understanding code and building these things, there's a lot of things it's not good at.

And understanding people and what makes people work and how to motivate people, , uh, how to understand people and what people actually want, that's something that is going to continue to be hard for people and, and us as technologists. I think that's a really important thing that we need to. To be part of this industry, and especially as the industry changes, as all, as all industries do.

Um, but, you know, change might be more rapid into near future. We'll see. Um, so yeah, don't be afraid to reevaluate yourself. You, you might be more than you thought you were. There might be aspects of yourself that you're good at, that you hadn't even given yourself credit for. And don't ex be afraid to explore new things, but you know, it's okay to be cautious.

[00:50:26] **Leo:** Absolutely. Um, thanks Matt. That, that was, that was incredible. Um, uh, really, really appreciate you taking the time. Uh, if the audience wants to find you, where, where's the best place to reach you? So, 

[00:50:37] **Matt:** uh, you can hit me up on, on Twitter or LinkedIn, uh, if LinkedIn just sent me a message as to where you found me.

Uh, if you're interested in my content, probably the best way of finding my stuff is to go to Matt eland.dev. I think I have links to most of my blogs and, and YouTube and things like that. I think I actually have a new blog that I need to get on that site too. But Matt elam.dev is a great way of getting my content, uh, uh, to tend to push out new stuff to Twitter and LinkedIn, uh, primarily.

[00:51:03] **Leo:** Excellent. And links to those will be in the show notes. Well, Matt, appreciate you taking the time. Sure. Uh, was was excellent to chat with you. Um, appreciate it. Thank you, Leo.
